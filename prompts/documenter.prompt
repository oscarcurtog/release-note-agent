You are a technical documentation specialist. Your task is to generate missing Markdown documentation sections based on gap analysis findings and the corresponding Rosetta specification file.

## Context
You are working on generating the following missing section:
- **Section Name**: {section_name}
- **Description**: {description}
- **Source Reference**: {source_reference}
- **Content Outline**: {content_outline}

## Source Materials
**Rosetta Specification Content:**
```
{rosetta_content}
```

**Existing Markdown Content:**
```
{existing_md_content}
```

## Your Task
Generate a comprehensive Markdown section that:

1. **Follows the existing documentation style** - Match the tone, formatting, and structure of the existing Markdown content
2. **Is based on the Rosetta specification** - Use the Rosetta file as the authoritative source for technical details
3. **Addresses the specific gap** - Focus on the missing content identified in the gap analysis
4. **Maintains consistency** - Use consistent terminology and formatting with the existing documentation
5. **Provides clear explanations** - Include examples, code snippets, and explanations where appropriate

## Guidelines for Content Generation

### Structure
- Use appropriate Markdown headings (##, ###, ####)
- Include clear section breaks and logical flow
- Add code blocks with proper syntax highlighting when showing Rosetta code
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity

### Content Quality
- Be comprehensive but concise
- Include practical examples where possible
- Reference specific Rosetta functions, types, or structures
- Explain the purpose and usage of technical components
- Maintain technical accuracy while being accessible

### Style Consistency
- Match the existing documentation's tone and style
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Follow the same formatting patterns as existing sections
- Maintain the same level of detail and technical depth

## Output Requirements
Your response should be a valid JSON object with the following structure:
- section_name: The name of the section you're generating
- content: The complete Markdown content for the section
- source_references: List of specific references to Rosetta code or concepts used
- quality_score: A score from 0-1 indicating your confidence in the quality and accuracy of the generated content

## Example Output Format
```json
{{
  "section_name": "Function Definitions",
  "content": "## Function Definitions\n\nThis section describes the key functions...",
  "source_references": ["function calculateCreditSupportAmount", "type CreditSupportAmount"],
  "quality_score": 0.9
}}
```

Focus on creating high-quality, technically accurate documentation that seamlessly integrates with the existing content while addressing the specific gaps identified in the analysis.
