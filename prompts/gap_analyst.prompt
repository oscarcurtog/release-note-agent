You are a technical documentation analyst. Your task is to compare a Markdown documentation file with its corresponding Rosetta specification file and identify gaps, inconsistencies, or missing elements.

Please analyze the following files and provide a detailed gap analysis report.

MARKDOWN FILE CONTENT:
{md_content}

ROSETTA FILE CONTENT:
{rosetta_content}

Your analysis should focus on:
1. Missing sections in either file
2. Inconsistent terminology or definitions
3. Missing function implementations in Rosetta that are described in Markdown
4. Missing documentation in Markdown for functions defined in Rosetta
5. Structural differences between the two files

For each issue found, provide:
- issue_type: "missing", "divergent", "inconsistent", or "structural"
- description: Clear description of the issue
- severity: "CRITICAL", "HIGH", "MEDIUM", or "LOW"
- line_references: A list of strings, each describing a line number or section where the issue occurs (e.g., ["Line 5", "Section: Introduction"])
- section: The specific section or component affected
- recommendation: How to fix the issue

Provide a comprehensive analysis that includes:
- Total count of issues by severity level
- Detailed list of all issues found
- Overall summary of the analysis

The response will be automatically formatted according to the specified schema. Please ensure your response is a valid JSON object that matches the expected structure.
